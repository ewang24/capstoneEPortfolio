This assignment involved writing a virtual memory manager. I had to implement a demand-paging virtual memory manager that used a TLB, page table and physical memory of 32768 bytes. I chose this assignment to represent the "system level understanding of the computer" learning goal. I believe this assignment is very applicable to the goal because through it I gained a much deeper understanding of how computers manage memory. As a result of working through the gritty details of implementing demand-paging, accessing a backing store, managing a TLB, etc., I came to understand how operating systems load pages in memory. This was also the most detailed assignment on memory that I completed. Because of this, I believe this assignment fulfills the learning goal.
