# capstoneEPortfolio

Welcome to my E-Portfolio. This repository contains a sampling of code from projects and assignments from my time completing my computer science degree at Westminster College. There are five different projects illustrating different aspects of Westminster's computer science degree. The chosen code samples are chosen to illustrate my familiarity with five key areas of computer science: databases, networking, operating systems, algorithms and software engineering. Also contained is my resume and a link to my capstone senior project.

Evan Wang, Westminster College Graduating class of 2018.
