This assignment was a chatroom application that I designed and implemented with a partner. It uses Java sockets to communicate with other machines running the same protocol. I have chosen this assignment to represent the "working with others" learning goal.
	Since I planned, designed and implemented this project with my partner, I think it reflects this goal well. We both wrote different parts of the application and merged them together to finish the project. Thus, the project involved both partner and individual work. In addition, this project was designed in collaboration with all the other teams in the class, as all the chat-clients had to be able to communicate with each other. We had to design and approve a protocol, then separately implement our applications. This project was my first exposure to designing a program in a large group setting. As a result of this large scale group work as well as the partner and individual work involved in the project, I believe it represents this learning goal well.
