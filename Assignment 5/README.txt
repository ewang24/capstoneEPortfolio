This assignment is the final project for my databases course. With my partner, I implemented a database representing the fictional Intergalactic United Nations (IGUN). We created a database to represent a whole fictional world of different solar systems, planetary species, extraterrestrial militaries, and the like. As I have already chosen assignments for the 4 CS learning goals, I chose this project mainly because it was a significant amount of work and I was happy with how it came out. Since it did involve some creative work, it could fulfill the college-wide learning goals of creativity and communication. This assignment was also useful in practicing my collaboration skills while working with my partner. I believe it demonstrates a firm understanding of database fundamentals and the ability to work with a database.
