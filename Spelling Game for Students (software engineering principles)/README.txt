This assignment was the culmination of my software engineering classes semester long project. My team and I implemented a spelling game, where the player controls a space ship. Asteroids labelled with words move across the screen and the player must shoot the incorrectly spelled words. I have chosen this project to represent the "understanding the concepts and techniques of software design" goal. As this was one of the largest projects I worked on at Westminster, I believe it represents this goal well. My team and I learned how to separate functionality of the project into separate pieces. We also learned how to use GitHub and version control to manage our project, which is an essential software design tool. We thoroughly tested our code throughout production. In addition, our project was written in several languages, including Python and Javascript. As a result of all of this, I believe this project fulfills the learning goal.

(This project is hosted in a separate repository. The link to this repository has been supplied. The project was also hosted online in a playable form but it is currently offline.)
