Reflection 4
This assignment involves implementing a greedy and dynamic algorithm to find the shortest path across a square matrix with weighted entries representing possible moves. I chose this assignment to represent the "effective problem solving" goal. I remember having difficulty grasping the concept of dynamic programming and finishing this assignment showed me that I was able to understand it. This assignment demonstrates the process of coming across a new problem and a new tool (dynamic programming) and learning how to solve the problem with the tool. As I was able to come to a good understanding of dynamic programming by the end of this assignment, I believe it well represents the problem solving learning goal.
